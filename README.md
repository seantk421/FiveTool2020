# FiveTool2020

FiveTool WordPress Theme Updated for 2020

- Based on the Underscores \_ starter theme.

- This branch includes webpack to bundle the CSS and JS files. Entry points are below.

<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>/src/js/main.js</li>
<li>/src/sass/main.scss</li>
</ul>

- Still includes the default underscores sass files. Probably will be removed and replaced with Bulma CSS framework.

Node Tasks 

<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>'npm run dev' - Runs webpack with watch enabled </li>
<li>'npm run build' - Outputs finalized JS and CSS files under /dist</li>
</ul>
