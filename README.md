# FiveTool2020

FiveTool WordPress Theme Updated for 2020

- Based on the Underscores \_ starter theme.

- This branch includes webpack to bundle the CSS and JS files. Entry points are below.

/src/js/main.js
/src/sass/main.scss

- Still includes the default underscores sass files. Probably will be removed and replaced with Bulma CSS framework.

Node Tasks 

'npm run dev' - Runs webpack with watch enabled <br />
'npm run build' - Outputs finalized JS and CSS files under /dist
